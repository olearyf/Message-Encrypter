# Message Encrypter

This program allows the user to encrypt and decrypt phrases using a Caesarean Cipher. A Caesarean Cipher is one in which a given keyword is chosen, and is placed at the beginning of the alphabet. Every letter thereafter is shifted, creating a new array of characters by which a phrase can be translated.
